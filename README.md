- `Repository:` 02-0-learn-react-steps
- `Type of Challenge:` Learning React
- `Mode:` Solo learn from an online course on Udemy
- `Deployment:` [Vercel]()

## Description

The goal of this project was to learn the basics of React. The project is part of the online course ["The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux, & More"](https://www.udemy.com/share/108PTK3@svd7LSKS9ey6F-mAoiPwPf0maT7NoRyTUO4HqpNWgU6hsdF-ESPRYJMbg9njS0DY-g==/) by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

This React project showcases how to manage and update state within a functional component using the `useState hook`. State management is crucial for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React applications. The project utilizes a simple step-based UI to help users understand the principles of state and how it affects the rendering of components.

## Learning objectives of this project:

The project demonstrates the following key concepts of React:

- Using the `useState hook` to manage state within functional components.
- Rendering different steps of a user interface based on the current state.
- Implementing previous and next buttons to navigate between steps.
- `Conditional rendering` to display components based on a condition (open/close).
